We want to generalize our DQN Agent from week 4 to generalize 
to different seeds. Therefore we train the agent with multiple 
learning rates and epsilon decays and train those on 4 different seeds.
As a measure per agent per seed we take the average discounted reward over the last 10 Episodes.
And after that we calculate per HP setting the mean and the std of the agents.
High mean means good performing agents, and low std means low varaince Therefore
better gneralization.


Results:
'lr=0.0001, ed=0.99, mean_reward=9.56, std=0.27', 
'lr=0.0001, ed=0.995, mean_reward=9.56, std=0.27', 
'lr=0.0005, ed=0.99, mean_reward=21.26, std=14.74', 
'lr=0.0005, ed=0.995, mean_reward=21.26, std=14.74', 
'lr=0.001, ed=0.99, mean_reward=19.46, std=12.51', 
'lr=0.001, ed=0.995, mean_reward=19.46, std=12.51'

We see that a learning rate of 0.0001 gives us the best 
generalization with std=0.27
But what we also see is that the agents under those hyperparameters
do not perform as well as the others with a mean of only 9.56
